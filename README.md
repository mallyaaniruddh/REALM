# REALM

The thesis explores using large language models (LLMs) for requirements engineering (RE). RE is a part of the broader software development life cycle, focusing on understanding the goals of software stakeholders and developing and managing software requirements to meet those goals. Unfortunately, RE tasks, such as requirements elicitation and specification, are mostly conducted manually and are time-consuming, which often leads to incomplete or imprecise requirements. The thesis aims to address this issue by exploring how LLMs can support at least partial automation of RE.
