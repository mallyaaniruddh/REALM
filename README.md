# REALM

## Overview  
This project explores how modern open-source and free LLMs can be used to mine user reviews and analyse sentiments involving sarcasm and emotional contradiction. It forms part of a broader academic investigation into using LLMs for Requirements Engineering tasks.

##  Models Evaluated so far
- **Mistral (via Ollama)**  
- **LLaMA2 (via Ollama)**  
- **DistilBERT** (via HuggingFace Transformers)
Each model was tested on the same input reviews with carefully crafted prompts to assess their ability to detect sarcasm and classify sentiment meaningfully.

## Note: 
- All models were run locally using the **Ollama framework** or HuggingFace pipelines  
- Results saved in `.xlsx` format for easy inspection and sharing
