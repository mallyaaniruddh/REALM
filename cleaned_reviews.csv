review
No longer works I use this app for recordings but ever since I got my new Nexus 5x it crashes everything I try to use it Please fix it
Causes force close After install Can not uninstall Not in admin list Thank goodness I had a backed up rom
Ashleya Dont install this app has bugs prevents your screen from sleep Will not let u uninstall this apparently no matter how many times u try to uninstall also has virus Crash my phone very bad app do not install
WILL NOT UNINSTALL Do NOT install This app will not stop running and will not uninstall Be aware You have now been warned Samsung Galaxy Sll My name is Doug Wooard and I am not hiding I cannot get this off my phone It can be force closed but comes back on
Amazing program Does most of what it says it does Never crashed I wish it had better bluetooth control though and also less sensitivity of the proximity sensor
This app will not uninstal and crashes my Galaxy S and drains my battery
Kept crashing Appeared to record but then I couldnt hear the recording because app would crash
Great response from the development team I submitted a crash report and within minutes they solved it with an update Super
Do not download I cannot delete this app From my phone When I force close it turns back on To top it off it doesnt announce caller
does not work htc desire 22 app force close after running configuration then refuses to work cleared cache moved to sd cleared cache still broke

awesome learning app i love learning through this app however when my phone crashed i became helpless I tried saving it on my Google drive but i could not view it the way i see it at Anymemo Tried uploading it on my drop box but it will not allow me to Can somebody please help me I lost one semester of notesflashcards for Nursing school which I could no longer retrieveVery much appreciate any help
Very buggy on Jelly Bean Frequent crashes and database corruptions seem to be the norm I had far better luck with Anki stabilitywise so Im just going to swap back
Wellcrafted AnyMemo features a good design and does what it promises Havent occured any crashs either
Nice until it crashes full of data I have been using for several years accumulating data today it crashes and I lost all my reports
Average Odometer does not let me enter tenths of a mile sometimes the app crashes when I try to enter anything in the Extra Data field
Good app suggestions for import improvements Pretty good Import crashes if there are missing fields App is set to enter volume and total price import with volume and price but no price per unit will end up showing 100 in price per unit Editing and saving without change updates to the correct values With only one car you still have to have an ID column it could skip this and allow choosing a single car It could recognise names of columns in CSV import rather than requiring you to enter them all even if the names match
Cannot import data to G Note2 I cant import the data from my old HTC Thunderbolt to my new Galaxy Note 2 App force closes during import Also no statistic charts or graphs in Jelly Besn version unlike the Gingerbread version which does Waiting for developer to respond
Force close Havent been able to add new fillups for the last two updates
ICS and JB Crashes on my galaxy nexus when loading graphs One of my favorite apps Been running it for 2 years
Perfect for what I need Works perfectly on HTC Incredible Razr Maxx I had a little trouble with import so with next phone I simply sent myself the backup file automatically created on old phone dropped it into folder on new phone Viola all mileage data is there no crashes
It worked fine until I upgraded it Now all it does is stop force close all the time I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling Still does not work

Buggy Constantly crashes when calculating statistics with ICS
Would be excellent if restore from another device worked Instead it crashes
Been using this since I got the Droid and it was working great Now it just keeps crashing upon opening even after uninstalling and reinstalling
After updating it force closes and wont even open on my motorola droid

Love this app but update force closes on G2
Consistant crashing on Import Data
Getting error and force close Unable to use EVO Android 22
Im a little irritated right now with this app since it keeps forcing closed when I try to restore my latest back up so Im not happy right now
Excellent program with all the trimmings Only problem force close after upgrading my Cliq to Android v21 and had to reinstall
This app is utter garbage when you have to reinstall it for any reason The import backups force closes on Heros and Desires Use aCar instead
Import causes crashes Please fix
Crashes when trying to import previously exported backup
To fix force closes when importing CSV files try different datetime formats I had wrong one selected Dev need better error handling for inputs
Force close when importing previously created backups I spend hours to import at first time and now forced to find another app
Force closes when importing backup csv file emailed developer and received no response epic 4g
Had been working great on G1 On G2 wandroid 22 force closes when try to import previous database
K9 is a very good email app Unfortunately K9 crashes randomly on Android 601 Moto g4 plus At times the stored emails get corrupted
Crashes daily I used this for years but since it started crashing every day Ill have to start looking for something better
Became buggy Ive been using this for a long time Now everytime I try to delete mail it freezes and crashes Reported bug many times and not so much as a response from it
I used to love the app I still use it but the app crashes then emails dont load properly After the update its a huge disappointment
Used to be good Crashes every time I select more than a few emails for deletion Also hard to visually distinguish between read and unread Uninstalling
Has nice interface and functions but keeps on overheating my phone and crashing
Great Great app but it crashes when it is used with Orbot and Orwall
Crash Crashing on nougat Cant use it
Stopped working For some reason today this has just stopped working Ive cleared my cache now tried uninstalling and reinstalling but get so far in the setting up process and each time the app just crashes over and over Today I missed a very important email because of this and STILL cant get it to work Very unhappy
Rubbish Error while entering email then crashes
K9 Mail 5 stars I prefer how reliable the k9 mail program is and rarely crashes
Frustrating enough to make you cry Just kept having crash issues Draughts were not completely saved resulting in frustration The interface gets in the way of itself making it hard to star messages without scrolling down the page The developers havent responded at any point But I could be the anomaly Ive since cleared data and removed all my accounts and started to put them back on one by one but this is not favourable It will also not let me export my account settings so I cant back my settings up if it goes t tsup again RSVP
A LOT of fcs When did all the forced closes crashes start This app has become really unstable
Problems sending email and numerous crashes I have used and loved this app for several years and thought it was the best email app our there But on my new S7 I am having nothing but trouble Constant problems when sending emails and crashes at least 4 times a day I will be uninstalling and trying to find another app
Keeps stopping Used to be great but now crashes stops several times each day on my new phone Getting ready to uninstall if not resolved soon
Keeps crashing Please fix otherwise fine
Sorry it now crashes and has become unusable
Used to be great then I had to switch because of wrong dates and therefore sorting on some messages lack of swipes a crash constantly occurring when receiving some type of messages probably malformed but no other client I have tried crashed because of that and missing features in notifications
Love it Extremely easy fast and accurate without crashing and best of all is FREE
Crashes Cannot Compact Unfortunately it stops regularly Installed new update tapped sync CRASH Have 4 accounts all POPSMTP all empty but now one shows larger size after compacting Pls fix
Still crashing When download many messages the app crashing every time
Crash always when start creating email Whats wrong Im using lolipop
Nearly perfect Does what I want it to do but with the recent update it keeps crashing
Keeps crashing since last update What changed Ive been using for years and have liked but K9 keeps crashing and is unusable for the past several days Im using a Nexus 5 with 601
Used to be great Needs updating I have used K9 for a number of years It previously worked wonderfully However it now constantly freezes and crashes Displaying a single email can regularly take 30 seconds I would dearly love to see this wonderful app updated to resolve these problems Running on Note 4 latest stock Verizon Android version
The best POPSMTP mail client of those Ive tried available from Play Store Four issues short of a 5start rating 1 The toofrequent crash and die failures 2 No indication of which account Im dealing with when in any of the settings pages Perhaps the account name beside the page title Settings nsaportalgmailcon would be a solution 3 No spelling checker please start with engb 4 The Unread messages indicator shown on the widget selector doesnt exist However these minor niggles wont stop me using K9 or send me out in search of a replacement Bigups to the developers excellent work Is this project still in development or are these issues never going to be addressed
Constantly crashes And when its not crashing Its very slow
NOT the best email app for android In fact not even better than stock So many times ive tried k9 mail now and came back disappointed every time It crashes randomly is impossible to set up with Exchange and does not even properly support Push The app boasts to be best android email app but in fact is not even better than the stock android mail client Quite the contrary In stock client you just enter MS Exchange email address and password done Not so in k9 Maybe one day when k9 mail does not suck Ill give it 5 stars Until then 1 star for repeatedly wasting my time
Best interface with unacceptable bug 80 of the time deleting emails results in crash notification Unfortunately K9 Mail has stopped just too irritating to accept Submitting crash reports have resulted in no feedback from K9 let alone a problem fix Its really a shame because it has my favorite look features Manage 2 important POP3 email accounts need better reliability stability
Used to be great but not good lately I have used this app for my email for years and it was really good until a few months ago Since then the performance has been terrible and it crashed multiple times per day Even doing something as simple as opening an email This week it has stopped showing new emails I get notifications that I have new email but when I open the app the newest message in my inbox is from 5 days ago Please fix these issues or I will have to continue using another app
Terrible app This app crashes at a minimum daily Sometimes it will crash several times per day My favorite thing is when I get 500 notifications for the same email Love that Also the nice 4 gig burn on my data from the turd running all night was a great surprise Do yourself a favor and skip this app
Just hate it Crashes with every try to login
Have used for years now But it has been force closing constantly since the last update Sometimes when im not even looking at the app Not happy Please fix this
My favourite email client when it comes to customizations however the seemingly unsolved issues below makes me go for other alternatives great drain on battery of almost 60 which reduces battery life while the phone is idle lots of heat generated from idle phone use frequent app crashes
Grrr Update 3 Now crashing almost every time I delete a message either from within the message or from the lost of messages Update2 Fixed link clicks so they work Good for most part but seriously annoying when on a daily basis it randomly turns off sync so messages stop being deleted on server No reason why just stops Dont notice till you log in via web and see that hundreds of emails that you thought were deleted are all still sitting there Waste of time
Install crashes on Android 5 on Z3 Even remove of the old version did not help
K9 This app crashes more than Evel Knievel
Crashes It crashes far too often making it useless
Crash city Nexus 4 stock rom latest and crashes every time I multi select emails eg to bulk delete Happens on Kaiten fork as well so clearly a major issue with the build and not update for months has fixed it despite constantly sending crash logs Giving up and moving to type mail
Installed Tried to set up Forced closed repeatedly Uninstalled
Crashes Continually crashes
Reboot problem Ive had the App for years and have been happy with it Until the Android 5 update on my Note 3 After the update my phone started crashingrebooting about once a day I spent weeks trying to track down the problem I did a reset on my phone and reinstalled my critical Apps and the problem was still present It would happen even when the phone was sitting on charge overnight I called ATT and they admitted that this was one of the problems they were seeing since the Android 5 update but all they could offer was a 100 phone replacement with no guarantee that this was solve the problem Then I realized that it often happened when I was checking my email with K9 I removed K9 rebooted my phone and it has only crashed once in the last 7 days So while there may be an underlying problem with Android 5 it becomes a critical problem with K9 installed
Crashes It crashes a bit too often everyday at least once or twice using galaxy s4
Was fantastic current version needs help Ive been using this mail client for years and it was phenomenal However about 2 or 3 updates ago it started crashing when opening certain messages or only displaying a tiny piece of the message with the rest of the screen just a blank white space More recent updates have changed and tweaked this problem but they havent managed to kill it yet making the app very hard to use for productivity purposes Back to webmail for me and will give 5 stars once the app is stable again
Like the App in general Works well but it does periodically crash which is a little annoying I dont seem to need to do anything as a result of the crashes just click on it and it runs as if nothing happens Other than that it works well
Crash crash crash WAS 5 stars HTC one m8 stock After update this app is broken Crash when opening messages Crash when sending email
Great Yesterday the app started crashing on both my phones I cleared the apps data and cache but adding my imap account caused the app to crash again I think k9 has a problem reading a few thousand mails Maybe you can check this
Crashes Used k9 for years now it crashes or blanks out all the time
Crash Cant handle a simple gmail Crashes upon checking credentials Android 50 on Samsung S5
Extremely Buggy Used to a very solid app for years now it crashes all the time and lots of problems sending mail Its a shame something changed with these guys
Update right now Yep Fixed crashing after updating to 52 or something Back to normal
great email client need spam filtering but was the 1 of the only email clients I could find that allowed you to select all messages and delete them at once Update its a year later and K9 still holds the crown for features compatibility and performance Update vicious bug with 51 Lollipopselecting a message or messages crashes the app The dog walkers fixed this within a few hours Wow
Still works for me The latest version 5003 is great Its fast doesnt crash and works with Hotmail you just have to know how I found out from other helpful people Heartily as opposed to hardly recommended
FIXED Thanks K9 great but has issues with Android v51 Due to its dark theming option K9 is my goto android email app Unfortunitely on Android v510 K9 force closes anytime one or more emails are seleted from the left side list check box All other funtionality appear to work This is true both on my Nexus 10 and 5 now that they run Android v51 while K9 did not have any issues with Android v502 hopefully this will be fixed soon
Used to be good Any time I try and add a new gmail account it crashes right after checking incoming server settings Tried reinstalling and now I cant even set up ONE account
Crashes Worked wonderfully for a long time then I did an update and it started crashing Uninstalled it thinking it might need a wipe cachedalvikfolder delete but now it wont even run after install Crashes on start Shameful
Last version upgrade is awful I used to love this app now I hate it With the latest version it freezes constantly and takes forever to load mail folders It crashes and doesnt remove deleted items from the inbox until I exit and go back into the app Sometimes only new mail is displayed in the inbox other times all the mail with no rhyme or reason Very frustrating since it was much better
Crashes Every Time on large messages Used to be good but it cant handle large emails any more Will they ever fix it
From 5 to 3 Since the last few update all it does is freeze up or crash This was my go to email app for all my Android devices Recommended to all family friends and coworkers Not anymore Looking for a good replacement
Broke on tablet Crashes on Samsung WiFi only Works great on my husbands S5 Please fix
Used to work well But its been crashing and hanging constantly and it takes FOREVER to get thru my email Needs serious fixes
So far no crashes on this phone However How do I print an email Also scroll bar still interfering with message stars Grrr
Updating and Crashing Since the update all I can do is upgrade folders then it crashes I hope a fix is coming soon
5201 is a nonstarter broken zoom frequenct crashes Ive reverted my install to 5010 it isnt perfect but it works In 5201 zoom is broken and it crashed a few times in the few hours Ive had it installed Unacceptable especially the broken zoom
Was great until recent update Once I open mail it crashes out
Has trouble with sorting and deleting Crashes trying to delete IMAP messages every time Although It is the ONLY app I found capable of sorting messages and showing Internet headers the reliability of some of these advanced function is only soso for large numbers of messages 10k Sorting by sender does not appear to work at all and sorting by date sent vs received date only sort of worked So overall a bit disappointing
Poor after update Was great till recent update that crashes its database Some emails that can be opened previously now not able to now even manual fetching of email become so slow and sometimes hang
What are you doing with a nice app Crash and slow Please cancel you update and go back to the working one Worked smooth for years but not anymore I hate when a nice app is spoiled by bad developers
New version crashes Ive been using K9 for years but you ruined it in this release 1everything is suddenly a lot slower 2app crashes while scrolling through messages in Sent folder 3App no longer goes straight to Inbox from phones notification bar Goes to folder list instead 4Why do you now have contacts pictures or initials on new messages and how do you turn this off 5Why the new drop down for cc bcc etc Its too big The old button was fine Ill try to an downgrade older version for now or use something el
Crashing after last update Was working well until yesterdays update Now its just closing without any messages when opening email Not on all but on most emails Pls return previous version
Worked perfectly in previous versions However v5201 crashes whenever one steels to view an email on Samsung Galaxy s5
Poor updates recently Pinch zoom into emails no longer working Stability issues and crashes when viewing some emails Long time user and disappointed in steps backwards
Latest update is hopeless Now cant send emails from one of my accounts UPDATE fixed by recreating accounts every folder had to be recreated The new Send screen is of poor design with the contacts taking up too much room The app now crashes every so often didnt happen before Very disappointed
PLEASE fix The latest updates have ruined this oncegreat app It crashes forcecloses and when I reply to messages all the text that I am replying to is a dark blue and cannot be seen I even downloaded earlier versions to install but V50 which might fix the problem fails to see my import backup file So until its fixed were all just stuck WHY update an app that was working Im a longtime user but will have to switch apps if this isnt fixed
Great app Have used it for some time Unfortunately started crashing every minute So frustrating Had to finally uninstall Cant give higher rating until latest updates get fixed
Used to like it Crashes constantly I also dont understand why i cannot move emails in trash deleted in error back into my inbox Its just not possible and should be In the trash can they cannot be fully loaded or replied to
Latest version is bad 5 stars prior to latest version now 2 stars The latest version introduced many bugs You can no longer zoom text Delete a message causes app to crash Scroll to previous message causes crash It seems to always end abruptly There are probably more problems but I dont want look for them
What are you doing with a nice app Crash and slow Worked smooth for years but not anymore I hate when a nice app is spoiled by bad developers
Update killed it Regular force closes S5 phone
Latest updates have destroyed great app No crashes ever until 2017 updates now crashes every 30 seconds Cannot read a full email before it crashes Please roll back to 2016 and test before reupdating
What are you doing with a nice app Taskbar problems slow minor crash cant zoom All have worked but not anymore Worked smooth for years but not anymore I hate when a nice app is spoiled by bad developers
Freezes and crashes incessantly and sometimes eats messages in composition I have been using K9 Mail for over 2 years due to being stuck with POP3 service on Verizon and K9 Mail has increasingly tended to freeze up and sometimes crash after the update to the latest version available on January 3 2017 it stopped working entirely It also sometimes loses messages in composition without saving a Draft Switched to Blue Mail which is missing some features important for POP3 but at least works
Best android email app Thank you for such a terrific free app The latest version has lots of cool features May I suggest some featuresfixes A setting to allow attachment list to appear on top or below message body Last update moved it to the bottom where they can be missed Make confirm optional on mark all messages as read Searches on a large database makes screen go black for a few seconds and then crashes on longer search strings Delete message from home task list deletes message but dialog box can remain
Bugs Search function and trying to read asent mail results in a crash

Used to be good butnthe new version crashes constantly even when I am using other apps I had to uninstall it
Since one of the latest updates it crashes quite often but DEFINITELY DOES NOT LET ME TO DELETE OR MARK READ FROM NOTIFICATION Samsung S7
Latest update is useless pinch to zoom doesnt work crashes regularly and runs ridiculously slowly please fix it urgently
Latest update breaks pinchtozoom and crashes app occasionally and polling folders is much slower than before Whatever the database update did made app interface and retrieving and searching messages sloooooower Motorola Droid Maxx
Still crashing after most recent update Wish you could move an email between email accounts
Still crashing frrquently after most recent update Recently crashed while drafting email and I lost all the email I had typed Wish you could move an email between email accounts Longtime user but frequent crashing has caused me to switch email apps
Ive been using k9 for years and have loved it but the last 3 or so updates have been horrible Slowed the app down and caused often crashes Im going to find an old version until this is resolved
Latest update is useless pinch to zoom doesnt work crashes regularly and runs ridiculously slowly please fix it urgently Ok pinch to zoom now fixed Still running like a tortoise and crashing all the time
Latest updates is causing the app to constantly crash on my Samsung You cant compose an email as it will crash while you are doing so
I thought it was doing okay but Keeps crashing Reduced rating down from 45 to 25 Im Not willing to send report because the Report button doesnt allow me to see whats being collected and for me to choose or approve I greatly appreciate being able to export settings receipts many other features Other than the need to fix crash problem I can only suggest 3 things 1 Allow messages to be date grouped in the Inbox with header title being a date like the way the default stock email app does it on Samsung Galaxy phones 2 Allow to only download headers again like default email app 3 Allow emails to Not be syncedstored on phone Especially when setup as an IMAP connection
App crawls to a halt crashes frequently I suspect that the app can no longer handle large amounts of IMAP email Please fix this
Really wanted to love it but last couple updates really screwed it up HUGE lag when getting emails date sorting is wrong crashes when adding attachments to emails sending errors all basic email functions that should just work Sorry
This app used to be great but recently has gone down hill crashes about twice a day takes forever to process requests eg to open a message Also crashes when deleting messages
Came back to see if it would would work on my phone and it crashed HTC ONE M9
Conceptually good and a decent design but a totally unreliable piece of software Im not the most demanding app user but I prefer programs to not CRASH every single time I use them while Im using them especially something as crucial as a mail client Look elsewhere for your email needs
This app used to be good on the S7 However now constant sync disable messages show up and are you there have to force close the app or turn off the WiFi and then turn it back on to refresh and get new emails but who wants to keep doing that all day Also blinking light notification no longer works unless you use sound or vibrate Due to all of these issues with the application that I can no longer recommend it to anyone until they get fix it
Update it became so bad after updates very slow downloading new mails crashes when deleting mails reply rarely works Now uninstalled and using a different app
unfortunally crashes all the time within 1 minute on marshmallow
Latest update is hopeless Now cant send emails from one of my accounts UPDATE fixed by recreating accounts every folder had to be recreated The new Send screen is of poor design with the contacts taking up too much room The app now crashes every so often didnt happen before Very disappointed 717 all of a sudden it cant connect to my Yahoo account authentication failed Whats going on Started working again without any changes from me Rating back up to 4
July 2017 update Still crashing frrquently I have sent dozens of crash reports Most often crashes when reading email and rotating my phone from portrait to landscape With certain emails problem is repeatable every time Wish you could move an email between email accounts Longtime user but frequent crashing has caused me to switch email apps
It just works Ive been using K9 for over a year with three email accounts Its never crashed and its always worked I like it better than my laptop email program
Scanner crashed Everytime I try to scan an ISBN the app crashes But if i enter the ISBN manually its fine I downloaded this app strictly for the scanner feature Who has time to enter hundreds of numbers manually
Great app Unlike the Goodreads app you can look at your library without any sort of internet which is great Not only that but you can import your Goodreads library This app saved me from having to redo my entire library Bit of a issue with the scanner crashing every once and awhile but other then that i have no complaints Would definitely recommend this app to all book readers and collectors
Needs an update Love that this app will sort by genre however hate it is not shareable with my family Another complaint is that every time I try to scan the barcodeISBN the app crashes so Im having to put our books in manually to get them sorted by genre
Just what I wanted I have been looking for an app just like this and now Ive found it I now have my entire library in my hand No more accidentally buying double copies I can even Mark the ones Ive already read One of the few apps on my phone that works just how it should happen has never crashed on me there are no ads And not once has it asked me for money
What a wonderfully designed app Content well organized and easy to use Iv already scanned 350 books I can think of nothing to improve this app The only issue Ive encountered is sometimes the app just closes down while Im using it When I reopen nothing is lost so no big deal Im searching to see if this developer has an app for movies Thank you for such a great app
Crashes fixed with new update Thanks for prompt response to the comments about the failed update Since update crashes all time App is essential to use with cataloguing book collection and causing big problems for me
Crashing Crashing upon opening app since update today Will change rating when satisfactorily resolved Samsung Note Pro and Samsung Note 3
Oh no it just crashed Please fux asap I love this app and have a lot of info stored
Updated and now crashes The app updated itself and now crashesit wont open
Works great many features Ive been using this app since 2012 and now have it on my M8 w Android 442 I only have about 1000 books but its perfect for my needs fast and has never hung or crashed on me

Crashes opening PMs Any fix for this Love the ap
What the hell happened to this app This used to be such a great app and now it seems like its been left to die a slow death There is no support and I have to keep refreshing the page everytime I click on a post It crashes every 5 minutes Sad
Buggy Crashes every time I open messages
Was good but doesnt work right anymore I honestly think its Facebook sabotaging apps like this first with the messaging crashing the app But now it messes up while typing Its a bit difficult to explain but it erases letters replaces them to the point that you cant write a coherent sentence without taking extra effort to fix it
Was good but slipping It was great for a while then started crashing when you try to read messages Then it would show notification alert but the notifications werent there until refresh Now its decided I dont have any friends should get some so it can show me things even though it still shows I have 200
Nice but crashes when I open messages Nexus 6p Android 711
Force closes when looking at messages Everything is good but it force closes when looking at messages on my moto e Dont understand why everything else works fine
Works as advertised Great app spam freeFor a user below that said it crashes when accessing messengerReason is messenger is a creepy FB feature that have your mic and camera turned on 247So tinfoil disabled this as a featureThis does not prevent you from downloading a messenger app
Crashes on Messages I would give this 5 stars but it crashes every time I try to access my messages in the app I have removed and reinstalled the app signed in and out even reformatted my phone But it still crashes when I click Messages every time without fail
Great for low memory phones Lets face it The official FB app keeps getting more bloated with every useless update and then forcing Messenger on us to IM people was a dumb move Luckily this app fixes all of that Its all in one the way it should be Theres a couple little things that Id gripe about but its nothing compared to how the official app is lol Edit 23 Oct 2016 had to switch to another app since messages dont work anymore The app will either force close or go to Play store
app crashes every time I open messages or try to message which means I just have to use fb messenger which sucks but whatever still a good easy app
Great except msgs Perfect but crashes every time I access messages Would be five star otherwise
App crashes The app crashes when I press the messages button
This app crashes a lot I like the concept here though The official app uses almost a gigabyte of space on my phone and constantly runs in the background
So far so good I like ti a lot only one issue so far it crashes every time I hit the messages button
Its a great app but Its a great app but it crashes when I open messages and that was the main reason I installed it so I could avoid having to use messenger I might as well install the official Facebook app
Crashes every time wit FB personal message I prefer this app to FB but it is a nuisance that it crashes every time I attempt to access personal messages that are apparently waiting for me This bug is consistent across my two devices I see other users have reported the same frustrating problem but the developer shows no interest in fixing it I hope they do fix it as it is otherwise useful
Great app but Facebook are slowly breaking it First Facebook blocked the API for messaging so the app crashes every time you try to access it and now it seems like theyve blocked events as well Any chance of a fix or workaround Managing events is pretty much the main reason I use Facebook
Moto G3 Messages menu crashes app on Moto G3 otherwise perfect
Annoyed I am having a problem with checking my messages it crashes every time I open it And I tried reinstalled and installed and nope still crashes I emailed 4 different times and no response and not fixed still either its been months btw Also as of today I cant post smiley face characters from Facebook This app SUCKS
Messages crashes app every time If I try to look at any Messages the app crashes
Cant open messages App crashes when I open up private messaging
Dont bother You click on messages the app crashes No thank you
Decent Facebook app Ive been using this app for a few years I begun using it because the size is smaller than the official app and also the privacy But Ive stayed with it because it barely glitches and is still fast and doesnt take up much space I would give it 5 stars but the app crashes every time I try to check my messages on it
Could be better Why cant I copy pages as links to paste into other threads there should be the option to do that Plus messages are broken and crash the app everytime I try to view them This may be something fb have done in trying to force everyone to download their awful app but could that also be looked at
Kept crashing back to back so uninstalled
Great Small ram footprint much faster and privacy However mine seems to crash when I tap the messages icon on top
Messages Crash App App crashes EVERY TIME I try to open messages For me it almost defeats the purpose of having this app since I will have to get the FB messenger app to read them anyway without my computer Ive been sending error reports for months whenever this happens and no fix
Cant use messaging Every time I try to open messages the app force closes Now its useless to me
Developer no longer updating the app Was a 5 app but after Facebook made it mandatory to use messenger on mobile browser this app started crashing
messages crash crashes when trying to open messages
Crashes when trying to access messages I think its because Facebook is serving a Play Store popup on the mobile site
UPDATEDStill new to this so will rate again but UPDATED Having to uninstall sadly because it crashes every time I try to open messaging Not uninstalling for that alone thats kind of the last straw PREVIOUS 3 stars So far I like the idea and intent but like some others have mentioned push notifications would be great Plus Ive had a couple use problems already in first day including having the app choke while trying to post a picture and shutting down entirely when trying to access the message section Well see how things continue
Unstable Great idea but force closes pretty constantly
Messages crashes
Works well when its not force closing This app wont run longer than 15 minutes without FC I would prefer to use this app instead of the official FB app but its so annoying to have it FCing all the time
App just kept crashing Maybe try doing a little more quality control before putting it out for installmine kept crashinguninstalled
Love it but Messenger crashes the app and closes it Messenger worked only once Fix this asap

Crashes accessing messages I like this app but it crashes trying to access messages
Keeps crashing App keeps crashing when I press the messages tab on the top
Great app but guessing FB have changed something as it now crashes when accessing messages
Message Access DENIED No longer can access messages from this app App crashes and Force Closes when inbox is accessed GOT TO FIX THIS ISSUE
Good except for messages The app was a real good alternative to Facebook I hate that Facebook was root installed on my new phone I immediately switched to this app A few months back the messages part stopped working and the app crashes when I try to access that part
Crashes when trying to view messages The newsfeed and notifications work fine but selecting the message icon crashes the app
Messenger function crashing This seems lighter weight than fb but the sole reason I tried it didnt workthe messenger function crashes upon switching to that tab
Crashes on messages Overall functionality and stability seem better than the major alternatives Ive tried metal folio etc The only problem is this app crashes when you try to access your messages in Mobile or Auto mode so I have to switch to Basic or Desktop whenever I want to access FB messages Still beats the godawful FB Messenger app
Too bad for just a web view App is pretty nice Althought it constantly freezes and crashes on my HTC M9 making it impossible to use Dislike
App crash When I tried to open my message It crashed
Messaging Needs a fix crashing every time I try to see messages
Messages tab crashes the app Turns out this is caused by Facebook mobile site no longer having messages support It would be nice if it didnt crash Disaim app works great for Facebook messenger though
Please fix So everyone is having the same issues with the messaging This was my go to fb app And now I cant even use it anymore without it crashing Please do an update to resolve these problems please
Needs some work The app crashes whenever I click on the message tab I tried unusual and reinstall as well to no avail Used to work great I love not being notified by Facebook and I like the app it just needs some maintenance
Didnt work for what I needed it for Facebook has decided to try and force users to use their messenger app even from the mobile site I never used the Facebook app and now I cant view any of my private messages on my phones browser I was hoping this app could fix that but every time I click on the private message notification it crashes I blame Facebook for this I cannot even think of a word colorful enough for what they are
Useless Fails at delivering basic functionality Crashes at will
Crash Its crashes when ever I click on messages
Trying to see a message makes it crash I got this to avoid Facebook messenger This app is utterly useless for me Every time I tap the message icon to read a message the app crashes Galaxy Note 5dont know if its the app or my phone Im very disappointed
Works but Messages hasnt been working for awhile It force crashes when I try to access them
Works great except for messages Facebook tries to force you to upgrade to messenger when you click on messages but it promptly crashes the app Need to figure out a way around that
Inbox I adore tinfoil but today whenever I tried to enter my inbox tinfoil crashed Does it have something to do with messenger I certainly hope that we wont need to use messenger
Love it but Love this app but it crashes every single time you click on the messages tab
Carolyn Keeps force closing
Getting worse Uploading multiple pictures is a massive problem Choosing one pic at a time is annoying especially if youve a whole album to upload and it times out after picking them all one at a time Edit Opening messages now crashes the application every time Itd be 4 stars of these issues were fixed
Crashes frequently Crashes when accessing PMs or attempting to PM

Awesome app FB is shutting down messenger In mobile view it crashes in forced FB lite it still functions Android 6 FB keeps getting no internet signal 1st world problems
Nice app Please fix the link between messenger and tinfoil as it just crashes every time
Very nice Good way to prevent Facebook from having their way with your phones battery Crashes every time I want to tap Messenger but I have many other means of communication so it doesnt bother me too much
Unusable It crashes all the time and its the only app that does this to me I dont like the regular Facebook app due to how powerhungry and data hungry it is This should be the perfect alternative But for a long time it has been crashing constantly and I give up
Facebook chat crashes This was a great app The chat crashes everyone on all my devices
Crashes every time I click on unread messages icon
Why does it crash when I have messages
Messages tab crashing application Cant access messages at all not sure when it started but crashes 100 of the time
Crashes when click Messages When I click on the Messages icon Tinfoil crashes
Messenger stopped working I liked this app because of the lack of permissions and the inclusion of messenger in a single app However recently the messenger function stopped working Whenever I select messenger the app closes and says unfortunately tinfoil has stopped
Crashes upon opening private messages Other than that it is good
Great potential but messages dont work It crashes every time I open the messages

Was working great til a few weeks ago on my Htc One M8 Now when I try to read messages the app just crashes every time I have still give it 5 stars because the app is so light on my battery compared to Facebook and Messenger Please fix this minor issue developer as having the inapp messaging is what makes this app so great along with saving battery life Peace
Better than the official app Whats up with messaging though The App crashes when I try to access my messages
Not bad but some flaws Works fairly well for the most part but crashes every time I try to open messages EVERY TIME Its completely up to date too
It was great Since last update cant open messages as app crashes every time
Messaging crashes the app Any time I check my messages Tinfoil immediately closes
Great app one bug Whenever I try opening a message the app crashes and this new but I think its because Facebook is punishing people who are not using there official app
Best app for facebook Force closes when trying to start a message but still love it
Got this to avoid messenger FCs all day I can no longer use this app to check my messages Theres really no reason for me to keep this app any longer because every time I try to open my messages it force closes on me
Cant access messages without app FCing One of the best simple Facebook apps but recently its been force closing and crashing as soon as I open the messages tab Both on the browser and in the actual app I love the app but if this issue is fixed I wont need to keep a tab on Chrome open
Uninstalled Almost every time upon opening the app it crashes Worked perfectly prior Ive sent you multiple crash reports Reply Uninstalling Your lack of a fix for so long
Messaging is STILL broken Application crashes 100 of the time when trying to access messages Its been weeks now is nothing really being done about this

Crashes when trying to message Crashes everytime when I click on message Otherwise 5 star So please fix
Private messages forced closed Tinfoil crashes now when you click on the private message icon This started happening only recently so facebook must have changed something on the backend

Inbox keeps crashing now Everytime I open inbox the app crashes
Crashes whenever trying to see messages This can be avoided by requesting desktop version on the browser Maybe you can work on a way of bypassing this
Inbox not working Touching inbox causes the app to crash since last update
Quick fix for messages crash Slide in from the right go to preferences and use either desktop version or basic version Seems fb is trying to force messenger on everyone Hopefully issue can be resolved soon
Crashes when I try to see messages I will love this if I can read my messages
Well Done Works as advertised Any issues you may experience are usually FB mobile site issues crashing is due to FB forcing FB Messenger on users You can only see messages via the FB Messenger App now Not Devs fault blame Zuckerberg Thanks Dev Nice and clean The only thing Id want is a darknight mode
Too many glitches Ubninstalling due to too many issues used to allow me on messages now it crashes every time Could never upload pictures Found a Facebook wrap around that still allows these functions It was good while it lasted
Damn Facebook they blocked messaging This app is perfect for me Only problem is since last week it crashes when I try to open any message Does anybody have a workaround I would really love to be able to keep using just this app without any hassle
Crashes every time I open messages Can we not find a workaround
I downloaded Tinfoil when Facebook made messenger unavailable through their mobile site since I refuse to download their official app Unfortunately Facebook seems to have broken Tinfoils messaging functionality as well since the app crashes whenever I try to access my messenges Other than that it seems like a great app so Ill definitely give it another try if you find a workaround for Facebooks pushiness

Messaging keeps crashing essaging keeps cr
Cannot use messages Cannot read or send messages Keeps crashing Facebook is pushing its messaging app Can we make a tinfoil for that too Love this app otherwise
Mostly wonderful I would previously have given it five stars but recently it has crashed every time that I click on the messaging icon
Normally a great app I have been using tinfoil since I first started using Facebook many years ago and love it I just upgraded to android 6 and suddenly it crashes whenever I try and open my messages I dont want to use any other Facebook app I would normally rate this 5 stars
I have been using and enjoying this app for quite some time however just this week it has quit allowing me to view my messages Every time I click on messages it crashes This is the main reason I use this app as I did not want to use the separate messenger from Facebook so I hope this is fixed soon

Great App New Messages Bug Though Hey guys I love this app and everything it represents although Facebook has recently tried to pull a fast one on you guys by updating their mobile browser messages platform It causes tinfoil to crash whenever you go to the messages menu And I figure its because Facebook sends a pop up for their messages app everytime you hit the message button in a normal mobile browser Hope you guys can fix this soon
NOPE Looks like FB has countered this app Every time I tried accessing my inbox it crashed
Good app Good app overall until recently it crashes instead of opening messages Tried clearing cache then cache and data then forced stop then uninstalled and reinstalled still crashing Also it would be nice to be able to post links so people can see them and to post to groups

Was Excellent App but now crashing Crashing when clicking the messengermessages icon
Messages crash If I tap on the messages the app automatically crashes and closes Apart from this I dont think there are any issues and it seems good but without the messages I cant use it
Great except one thing Great app but crashes if you do anything with messages
Going to view messages crashes the app Used to work doesnt anymore
FIX IT ASAP I cant open my inbox messages Each time I tap that chat icon suddenly unexpected force close It wasnt like this when I just download it
Crash Crash all the time
All I use except for messages Recently it has been crashing when I try to navigate to messages Facebook mobile works for messages which means the problem lies in the app itself Before this issue the app was perfect
Message not working I think this does a great job with most facets of Facebook Just one thing it crashes when I go to Facebook messages
Crashes Downloaded just so I didnt have to use fb messenger Crashes Looking for something else
Great one annoying bug though I noticed that lately its crashes whenever I try to navigate to messages Pretty certain its due to Facebook trying to cram their messenger app down our throats whenever we want to view messages
Crashes to home screen everytime i click on messages Please fix
Why is clicking the message option crashing the app Otherwise pretty good
Great app but I have always used tinfoil for Facebook Its a great app but messages seem to crash the app
Messages dont work Overall its good but the app crashes every time I try and read my messages
Great app I really like this app but in the current version whenever I try to open messages the app crashes
Awesome but The messages make the app crash smh
Crashes Crashes every time you try to open messages
Crashes when opening messenger Whenever i go to open the Facebook messages the app just crashes So cant use the messaging function at all through the app Otherwise its a good app
Crashes when trying to open message Love the app but Ive been running in to a big where the app crashes when I try to access messages Im on a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge
Crashes when opening Messages
Good concept It has a bug when clicking on the messaging tab the app crashes
Crashing issue Going to uninstall the app as it always crashes while going to the message tab
Facebook message crashes the app when you select it
Crashes When Opening Messages Id change my review to 5 stars but over the last week or so any time I open the messages section the app immediately shuts down Was hoping there was a patch or some update but I havent seen anything so for now 2 stars
Viewing messages causes it to crash As mentioned in title brilliant app otherwise once fixed will 5
Disappointed This used to be such a great app but since upgrading to Android 60 it has begun freezing and crashing with tiresome regularity to the point where its almost unusable now
Crashes when I try to read messages Just that Every time I try to read messages the app crashes Just started today I really dont want to go back to FB messenger
Crashes and stalls a lot Crashes and stalls a lot
Bugs Force closes on Droid 2 after 60 update Otherwise phenomenal app will bump back to five stars after it is fixed
Keeps Crashing My friend download this to my phone The app is but whenever Im on the screen goes away Got to keep logging back on
Messages The app was working fine up until a few days ago Now I cant check my messages without the app crashing Fix the messages please
When I click on a message the app crash
Its a great minimal permissions app but It crashes far too often for me
Crashes on marshmallow Great app but crashes every 2 minutes since upgrading droid turbo 2 to android 60
Good but Crashes constantly on my Droid Turbo 2 with the Android Marshmallow update Ive been using this app for a fairly long time and Ive never had any problems until now
Prior to Android 60 this app worked flawlessly Now it crashes constantly
Almost Great idea but crashes constantly
Crashes constantly on 601
Latest version force closes Ever since the last updated for this app Ive had nothing but issues with force closes Running Android 60 marshmallow Really liked the app before these force closes started
Crashes consistantly Love the app and how lightweight it runs been using it for almost a year now but in the last week its started crashing every time I use it Never on initial startup but in the middle of using it Never with a specific reason either I could be writing a comment trying to view a link or just scrolling the timeline and itll crash at random withing a minute of opening the app
Better than the Facebook official app No ads awesome thing But I think you could make it faster Also it crashes when I try to full screen a video and when I put add an emotion in the description of something I share It doesnt appear in the post But its an awesome app generally after all there are no big problems Keep on the good work
Keeps crashing Att Lg g4 60 I love this app but it keeps crashing nowhalp XD
Not that great This is better than every other Facebook app but it just severely crashed on me When I say severely I mean it locked up as I was typing and completely became unusable I couldnt access it at all Then a minute later it showed a popup that said tinfoil has basically crashed and I just chose OK instead of reporting Cant post pictures either Man this app is bad
Just works Lg g2 pro Android 44 Used for at least 3 weeks Installs ok No force close issues App works as described Much better than other alternatives to official app
Crashes locks up jumpy This app does NOT do what it claims Its a browser for fb but it visually shakes locks up to the point of a restart Deleting this waste of space
Crashes Crashes and hangs on galaxy s6
Still cant load picture UPDATES OCT 2215 STILL CANT UPLOAD PICTURE FROM THE THE APP TIN FOIL UPDATE Wont let me upload pictures Fix that be near great replacement for Facebook minus that it is crashing couple times in a day at times
Terrible Use this to avoid Facebook massively intrusive permissions Then a couple months ago the app pretty much became useless Never loads Constantly crashes Cant upload with out it locking up and having to start over no clue why this app turned worthless used to do everything in spades
Frozen All it does is freeze I have to force close all the time to get it working and the back function takes me out if the program instead of going to the previous page It used to work better
Crashes and burns Deleted all friends and their posts does not seem to like some native browsers or bein on SD card or maybe needs to have dreaded Messenger installed uninstalled until it improves
Not fully functional Trying to access messages causes app to crash
Works great but Get rid of the messages icon as it crashes the app Still using messenger from fb So unless there is a fix Just need to remember not to click on it
Nice Wrapper Crashes every time I click on the messages icon Pretty big problem that needs to be fixed Facebook has replaced their messages icon with the sales page now
Good but crashes needs reopening Great alternative that has a few issues I hope get ironed out The occasional crash can be very annoying tends to happen more some days than others Good alternative with good speed features but random crashes make it infuriating at times But hey it still beats Facebook messenger thats for sure Ill take the crashes over those memory hogging battery draining intrusive spy apps any day thankyou Just find why it crashes fix it please devs I had a good time with it the other day with 2crashes
Crappy app Keeps logging me out and making me do photo id checks Doesnt accurately show the correct comment that was liked Slow Crashes and on and on Facebook in general is getting stale Time for the next thing
Needs work Crashes instantly if I try to use Messages
Good app It is a good way to cut down data usage Only issue is you cannot message from it as it just crashes Otherwise I would give it 5 stars
Crashes It crasheswhen you view messages
Good but still some bugs Galaxy Tab A 6 app crashes every time I touch the messages icon at the top of the page Works OK otherwise Thanks and keep up the good work
Opening chat crashes app Installed as FB messenger permissions are a joke Sadly this alternative was an instant fail
Cannot access messages Love the app and the idea behind it but crashes every time I try to check my messagesWhen this bug is fixed I will be happy to give 5 stars
Good but can get much better Fix the messenger crash problem and fix so you can watch live streams The thing that makes me too use this app is that you can choose to get recent news every time you start the app Thats a big plus
It works so so Does everything except it crashes if you get to do messenger
This app was great for awhile but has become increasingly buggy Not having to install Messenger was the original reason installed it but then Messages became unavailable with the app crashing every time to try to check them It got to the point that it was crashing three or four times a day so I replaced it It was great for a long while but has been steadily declining for a long while as well Too bad
I dont know whats going on but last few days I havent been able to comment on an posts at all I used to love this app used it exclusively for years but this is a major issue already crashed everytime I hit messages or try to share anything with a specific person please fix n Ill give 5 stars again
Crashes every time you try to access messages There is an easy work around for that issue when loading messages the useragent variable must report as a desktop version not a mobile browser and the messaging works just fine I was looking for an app to bypass facebooks malicious scripting along with its ability to launch the google play app when clicking the message icon This app seems allow many malicious scripts While firefox mobile allows me to change the useragent variable and load messages
Downloaded for fb messenger ability This crashes the app
Crashing always crashing bro we need an update
Crashes when I try and open messages
Very fast problem crash report update fix response Rare top of the heap Dev team
Messenger does not work in this wrapper and for a long time just clicking on the icon crashed the app Now that is gone but with the latest version the screen goes white when clicking on a link When ones goes back another page is loaded and so you cant follow down your timeline Used to like it a lot for years but right now it is unusable

What The Hell The app crashes after you delete a previous ringtone doesnt loop when in settings nor does it play when listening to it in settings

What happened to this app Used to work great loved it but now everytime I hit the search the app closes and when I have to scroll to find a song because I cant use the search or it closes the song doesnt download fully Maybe Ill just uninstall it and reinstall it and see if that fixes the problem If not I guess Im just going to get rid of it Oklooks like that fixed the problemthe app is back to being awesome again

What happened This was my favorite app keeps crashing wont load Please fix
WHY DID YOU DO THIS Worked great until latest update DONT DOWNLOAD It will be a waste of time App force closes when you search wont fully load when you find your song and will crash if youve made it any farther than that Such a shame because it used to rock Hopefully youve read this review and saved yourself the trouble
Updates wrecked it Wont load songs to crop Try to search library for song as soon as hit search error causes it to crash and close Not sure why hasnt been fixed after all bad reviewsI waited ages hoping they would fix it Never did
Now Broken Like many others I have had this app since Ive owned a smartphone I just moved from the HTC One M8 to the HTC One M9 I probably never updated the app on my M8 and never had an issue I reinstalled it on my M9 and it is completely broken If it doesnt crash It wont create or clip a ringtone anyway So long and thanks for all the ringtones
What happened Ive had this app forever and now it is constantly crashing I think the developers abandoned it
Sux now Been using it for years Havent made a ringtone with it for about 6months but it force closes everytime Even after uninstalling and reinstalling
Garbage Like everyone else is saying it takes forever to load but then ends up crashing IF it works I can only load 6 seconds of a song FIX THIS NOW
What once was perfect is currently experiencing too many to justify keeping installed Dont get me wrong this app was marvelous it really tussled by muffet but now it crashes when you search doesnt save file properly and fails at setting ringtone Alas now I must search elsewhere for an app to do what I could easily do in 10 seconds on a pc
Doesnt work anymore I hate to put such a bad review on such a good app but it doesnt work anymore When Im searching for a song or at least try to I type in 2 letters everytime and it crashes I have had another user of this application contact me to see if it worked because he had the same problem I have Please fix
Used to be great Not sure what happened but now it Force Closes all the time Very disappointed
Cant find anything on SD card Plus crashes often when I start searching Other than that still the best Edit found a workaround navigate to mp3 with ES Explorer or other file viewer and open with Ringdroid
